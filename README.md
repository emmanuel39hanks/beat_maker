# Overview

_Preview of the Drum Pad we are going to be creating_

![Drum Pad Preview](https://cloud-edj42rbl8.vercel.app/0screencapture-drum-emmanuel39hanks-repl-co-2020-11-07-23_43_18.png)

Apart from building the drum pad, you will also be learning about different types of events, functions, styling, and more with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Final Code: [GitHub](https://github.com/emmanuel39hanks/beat_maker) | Demo: [Live](https://drum.emmanuel39hanks.repl.co)

## Getting started

Let's start by setting up our coding environment using [repl.it](https://repl.it/), a free, online code editor.
To begin, navigate to [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/html), and create a new repl.

You will see that there are already three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js. Navigate to your `index.html` file, and we will work on the structure of our drum pad there. 

## HTML:

We will write most of our HTML code inside the `<body>` tag. Let's start by creating a header that displays the text `DRUM PAD` using the `<h1>` tag:

```html
<h1>DRUM PAD</h1>
```

Just under the `<h1>` tag, we will have three rows and four columns of buttons. Each buttons will be created with the `<div>` tag. You can think of the `<div>` tag as a box or container, and we are using it because each of our buttons will have a boxy look.

```html
<!-- Parent div -->
<div>
<!-- nested child divs -->
  <div>A</div>
  <div>B</div>
  <div>C</div>
  <div>D</div>
  <div>E</div>
  <div>F</div>
  <div>G</div>
  <div>H</div>
  <div>I</div>
  <div>J</div>
  <div>K</div>
  <div>L</div>
</div>
```

To quickly break this down. We have a parent `<div>` tag that nests our button `divs`, and we label our buttons with letters to easily identify them, and like I mentioned above, each button will be given a boxy look, and that's why we are using `div` tags.

<details>  
<summary>Here's what your entire index.html file should look like so far:</summary>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>DRUM PAD</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>DRUM PAD</h1>
    <div>
        <div>A</div>
        <div>B</div>
        <div>C</div>
        <div>D</div>
        <div>E</div>
        <div>F</div>
        <div>G</div>
        <div>H</div>
        <div>I</div>
        <div>J</div>
        <div>K</div>
        <div>L</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
</details>

When we run our code, it will look like this at the moment:

![Preview of HTML with no CSS](https://cloud-hqtl5tea3.vercel.app/0screencapture-drumpad-emmanuel39hanks-repl-co-2020-11-03-08_36_46.png)

# CSS:

We will style our drum pad with CSS, which will make our drum pad look visually appealing.

Navigate to your `style.css` file and add the following code:

```css
body {
  background-color: #fff;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  
  /* To learn more about the CSS flex box, check out the hacking section */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  /* To learn more about the overflow property, check out the hacking section */
  overflow: hidden;

  /* To learn more about the font-family property, check out the hacking section */
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

When we run our code, you will notice that our content has been aligned to the center, and that's because we changed the properties of our `<body>` tag, and the `<body>` tag renders content to our web page.

![Preview of HTML with CSS applied, to change the layout](https://cloud-bp7m8g6di.vercel.app/0screencapture-drumpad-emmanuel39hanks-repl-co-2020-11-03-08_35_57.png)

We're going to be use classes to add styling to our `div` tags, and to use classes we have the HTML attribute `class=""`.

Let's navigate back to our `index.html`, our parent `<div>` tag will be given the class name `pad` and our nested `<div>` tags, the class name `box` which will apply our classes styling to our HTML tags.

```html
<!-- Here we give the parent div the class name pad -->
<div  class="pad">
<!-- Here we give the nested divs each the class name box that will add styling of each individual pad -->
  <div class="box">A</div>
  <div class="box">B</div>
  <div class="box">C</div>
  <div class="box">D</div>
  <div class="box">E</div
  <div class="box">F</div>
  <div class="box">G</div>
  <div class="box">H</div>
  <div class="box">I</div>
  <div class="box">J</div>
  <div class="box">K</div>
  <div class="box">L</div>
</div>
```

Now navigate your `style.css`, and we will change the header's font size, color, and letter spacing using the following code:

```css
h1 {
  color: #000;

  /* To learn more about the font-size property, check out the hacking section */
  font-size: 5vw;

  /* To learn more about the letter-spacing property, check out the hacking section */
  letter-spacing: 6px; 
}
```

Then create three rows and four columns to correctly align the buttons and give them a box or container look.

```css
.pad {
  width: 500px;
  display: flex;

  /* To learn more about the justify-content property, check out the hacking section */
  justify-content: space-between;
  
  /* To learn more about the flex-wrap property, check out the hacking section */
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

We will change each of our button's properties, with the class name `.box`, to give them unique styling.

```css
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 10px  0;

  /* To learn more about the box-shadow property, check out the hacking section */
  box-shadow: 0  8px  6px  -6px  black;
  background-color: #444;
  display: flex;

  justify-content: center;

  /* To learn more about the align-items property, check out the hacking section */
  align-items: center;
  font-size: 20px;

  /* To learn more about the rgba function, check out the hacking section */
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);

  /* To learn more about the border-radius property, check out the hacking section */
  border: 4px solid;
}
```

And when we rerun our code, it should look like this:

![Preview of HTML with layout CSS applied, the pads are in a grid and all gray borders](https://cloud-edj42rbl8.vercel.app/0screencapture-drum-emmanuel39hanks-repl-co-2020-11-07-23_43_18.png)

We will then add code that adds hovering effects, inactive or active states to our buttons:

```css
/* To learn more about the lighten function and :hover pseudo class, check out the hacking section */
.box:hover {
  background-color: lighten(#444, 10%);

  /* To learn more about the cursor property, check out the hacking section */
  cursor: pointer;
}

/* To learn more about the :active pseudo class, check out the hacking section */
.box:active {
  /* To learn more about the darken function, check out the hacking section */
  background-color: darken(#444, 10%);

  /* To learn more about the transform property, check out the hacking section */
  transform: scale(1.1);

  /* To learn more about the transition property, check out the hacking section */
  transition: all  0.2s;
}
```

Now that we have finished our styling, let's now work our drum pad functionality.

## JavaScript:

When you click on the buttons, we have no sound. We need to write some JavaScript code that will play sounds.

Let's navigate to our the `index.html` file to link the JavaScript file. Then, inside the `<body>` tag at the bottom, we will link our `script.js` file with the following code:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

Now navigate to your `script.js` file and add the following code:

```javascript
function play(link) {
    let audio = new Audio(link);
    audio.load();
    audio.play();
}
```

Here we created a function called `play()`, it receives a parameter, which is `link`. This is the link to the sound. We then create an audio object and pass `link` to the object. Now we can just load the audio with the `load()` function and play it with the `play()` function. A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task, it is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

All we need to do now is find a way to play sound when a button is clicked.

Navigate to your `index.html` file, we want the sound to play when each button is click, we will need a way to call our `play()` function. We will use an HTML attribute called `onclick=""`, learn more about the onclick event here: [onclick events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp), it helps us call a function when a tag with the attribute is clicked on, and inside the quotation marks, we pass the `play()` function and pass a link as the parameter to the function. And when a pad is clicked, it will get triggered and call the `play()` function and play the sound from that link:

```html
<div class="pad">
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/SD0025.mp3')">A</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/SD0010.mp3')">B</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/SD0000.mp3')">C</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/RS.mp3')">D</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/OH25.mp3')">E</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/MA.mp3')">F</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/CY0010.mp3')">G</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/CH.mp3')">H</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/CB.mp3')">I</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/BD0010.mp3')">J</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/BD0000.mp3')">K</div>
  <div class="box" onclick="play('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/CP.mp3')">L</div>
</div>
```

If you run your code now, you should see a working drum pad!
